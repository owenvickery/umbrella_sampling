                                    **SCRIPT OVERVIEW**
                                        
This script eases the setup up of Potential of Mean Force (PMF) windows in a reproducible manner. There are three main functions within the script: 

- Initial setup of the umbrella windows
- Quality control check of the energy landscape and histograms
- Automated histogram gap filling between non overlapping windows 

This script is designed to follow on from your initial pull simulation, which is highly user specific. Therefore all that is required in addition to the standard gromacs files are:

- a two column file in the format of (time and reaction coordinate)
- The pull trajectory 

**WARNING:** The two files must relate in a 1:1 fashion. 

                                     **REQUIREMENTS**

- Python v3 or higher
- Numpy
- GROMACS v5 or higher


                                        **FLAGS**

Available flags for use.

      -func (setup, concat, wham, plot, fill)             
      -f (.xtc)

                                          **SETUP**

To setup the initial PMF use the flag (-func setup).

This section requires the following files to work correctly.

- index
- topology
- production mdp 
- structure
- pull tracjectory
- pull reaction coordinate

Optional flags 

- int     window interval (default 0.05 nm)
- start   collective variable start (default start of pull)
- end     collective variable end (default end of pull)
- min   switches off energy minimisation
- tpr   switches off production tpr production
- tpronly   only makes production tpr files (requires energy minimised files)

Using the following directory structure as an example:

    | --    BUILD
              - topol.top, index.ndx, production.mdp
    | --    PULL
              - pull_pullx.xvg, pull.tpr, pull.xtc
                

To setup the PMF between 1 and 3 nm with a window spacing of 0.05 nm, the command line would look like:

    python pmf.py -func setup -n BUILD/index.ndx -p BUILD/topol.top -mdp BUILD/production.mdp -s PULL/pull.tpr -f PULL/pull.xtc -pull PULL/pull_pullx.xvg -start 1 -end 3 -int 0.05


If you wish to extend the PMF from 3 to 4 nm, you can use the offset flag (e.g. if you have 40 windows already, enter 40; the script will write windows from 41 onwards (flag -offset 40)).

For example.

    python pmf.py -func setup -n BUILD/index.ndx -p BUILD/topol.top -mdp BUILD/production.mdp -s PULL/pull.tpr -f PULL/pull.xtc -pull PULL/pullx.xvg -start 3 -end 4 -int 0.05 -offset 40

The output from this script is in the following format.

    | --    umbrella_windows
                | --    setup_files_(timestamp)
                                - collective variables, gromacs outputs, topology, mdp, index, em_out-[1..40]
                | --    frames
                                - window_[1..40].pdb
                | --    minimised
                            | --   window_[1..40]
                                        | --    tpr, gro, edr, log
                | --    windows
                            | --   window_[1..40]
                                        | --    production tpr
                | --    analysis


The script will also provide you with a overview of the PMF windows (a copy of the this table is saved in the setup_files directory).

Column 1 (proposed) is the CV windows you choose. 

Column 2 (selected) is the CV windows selected by the script ( closest value to Col 1 )

Column 3 (final) is the CV in the final production window

Column 4 (S-P) is the selected CV minus the proposed CV

Column 5 (F-S) is the final CV minus the selected CV

Column 6 is the window number for each CV used in the script

                                        **WHAM ANALYSIS**

Here the script can run a rudimentary analysis on your PMF. 

The script copies the pullf files from the windows directory into the analysis folder. If you have multiple part files within the windows directory they are concatonated together.

First you need to fetch all the pullf files from the windows directory. The script can do this for you.

This command needs to be run from within the analysis folder.

If you wish to concatonate the pullf files within the current working directory you can use the flag -current.

Flags 

- -start   window start number (int)
- -end       window end number (int)
- -current   concatonate in working dir (optional)


e.g. concatonate and copy from windows directory

    python pmf.py -func concat -start 1 -end 40 

e.g. concatonate files from the current working directory

    python pmf.py -func concat -start 1 -end 40 -current


Your analysis folder should now contain the window_\*\_pullf_com.xvg and window_\*.tpr files from the windows directory.

To create your landscape with gmx wham you need the two files (please use these names): tpr.dat and en.dat. 

These files contain a single column of either the names of the tpr files or the names of the pullf files. Note that they have to be in the same order.

e.g.

    **tpr.dat**   |        **en.dat**
    window_1.tpr  |  window_1_pullf_com.xvg
    window_2.tpr  |  window_2_pullf_com.xvg
    window_3.tpr  |  window_3_pullf_com.xvg
    window_4.tpr  |  window_4_pullf_com.xvg
    window_5.tpr  |  window_5_pullf_com.xvg


The script can run wham for you, however it only uses the basic setting (this wham is run at 310 K) so I would advise you to run it separately.

Flags

- -pmf provides the output file name of your PMF.
- -boot is the number of bootstraps to do.
- -start is the amount of time to discard as equilibration.

e.g. 

    python pmf.py -func wham -pmf bsres.xvg -boot 200 -start 5000

For some reason gmx wham runs equally well on 1 core as it does on all the cores. This allows you to run multiple whams simultaneously and doesn't slow your computer down. Therefore the script will ask you which core to run on (note the cores start from 0).

If you wish to run gmx wham outside the script add the following prefix to the gromacs command.

<pre>
    "taskset --cpu-list 0" 

    e.g. taskset --cpu-list 0 gmx wham -if en.dat -it tpr.dat -bsres bsres -temp 310 -nBootstrap 200 -b 5000
</pre>

                                        **PLOTTING**

Once you have your initial PMF, you need to run some basic quality control checks.

Here the script will provide:

- Energy landscape and error (if calculated)
- Normalised histogram sum
- Histogram overlap
- Histograms

Flags

- -pmf      name of your energy landscape.
- -hist     name of your histograms.
- -cutoff   overlap cutoff adjustment.

e.g. 

    python pmf.py -func plot -pmf bsres.xvg -hist histo.xvg

You will be asked various questions, reply with a numerical value or return.

    PMF tick interval length on the Y axis [eg 10]: 10
    min and max Y (press enter to use defaults) : 0 100      (min and max separated by a space)

The plot will be saved as 'energy\_landscape\_(time_stamp).png'.

The minimum quality level of the landscape is denoted by the red line.

- The normalised histogram sum has a cutoff of 20 %.
- The histgram overlap has a default cutoff of 3 (changed with flag -cutoff).

If you wish to check the convergence of the pmf with increasing simulation time.

e.g. 

- 5-10 ns 
- 5-15 ns
- 5-20 ns

You can provide multiple landscape files files to the -pmf flag. (each file should be separated by a space).

e.g. 

    python pmf.py -func plot -pmf bsres_5-10.xvg bsres_5-15.xvg bsres_5-20.xvg -hist histo.xvg

In this case you be asked an additional question. 

    what is the timestep? 5

This sets the x axis of the line graph showing the energy minima over time.


                                        **GAPS**

Unless you have a simple system, you will get gaps between your umbrella windows.

Therefore this script will fill in the gaps using the same criteria as the analysis plot.

The normalised histogram sum has a cutoff of 20 %.
The histgram overlap has a default cutoff of 3 (changed with flag -cutoff). 

To fill in the gaps in the umbrella windows coverage we will use a similar command as in the setup.  

However you need to provide the histogram file as well and the offset flag otherwise it will overwrite your existing windows.

e.g.

    python pmf.py -func fill -n BUILD/index.ndx -p BUILD/topol.top -mdp BUILD/production.mdp -s PULL/pull.tpr -f PULL/pull.xtc -pull PULL/pullx.xvg -start 1 -end 3 -int 0.05 -offset 40 -hist umbrella_sampling/analysis/histo.xvg

Iterate over these steps until you have a coverged PMF.

Good luck
